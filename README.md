# LanguageTrainer #

Welcome to LanguageTrainer — a pet project designed to help learners improve their language skills.

## Purpose ##

I created this project for a few reasons:

- To help my sister with her English studies. Since she owns an iPhone, I thought a simple web app would be an ideal solution.

- To improve my skills in coding and project development, and to gain hands-on experience with building applications.

- To have fun and experiment with new technologies!

While this application is not original and there are many similar apps available, I decided to build it because I saw it as a fun opportunity to learn and create something useful.
## Current Status ##

This project is still in its early stages, and the README will be updated as the project evolves. Stay tuned for more features and documentation!
